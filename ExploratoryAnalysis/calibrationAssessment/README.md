## Calibration assessment

Data assessment of calibration data variability. The exported broadband data (both experimental and calibration) demonstrate signal ramping at the terminal edge of a transducer's frequency range. Other broadband publications identify the same problem but have chosen subjective cutoff ranges of 5-10kHz, presumably truncating areas of unstable data collection. The purpose of this assessment is to find a more objective way of choosing data cutoffs.
